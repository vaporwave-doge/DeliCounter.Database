  "Description": "GTA SA style gang wars, static encryption only\n- Ballas, Vagos, Triads and Police, each round introduces a new gang and they're all hostile towards each other\n- GTA SA pistols mostly drop from Ballas and Vagos, most of the other SA weapons will randomly drop from the Triads and Police\n- Lots of meat to shoot\nPROBABLY works best with spawnlock enabled, but there is a free riot shield at the beginning if you're a fan of always being out of ammo",
