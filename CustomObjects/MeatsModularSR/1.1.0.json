This rifle is full power and lets you know it, but recovers quickly from its higher recoil once kitted out so pace your shots. \nIn this pack are:\nSR25\n10 and 20 round magazines (compatible with P762 magazines)\n457mm and 558mm barrels\n3 handguards\n2 insane muzzlebrakes\nPure recoil (you'll see what I mean when you install this)",
